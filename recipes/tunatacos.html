        <li>2 tablespoons <strong>cream</strong></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon <strong>fresh lemon juice</strong><em>(or lime juice)</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup <strong>chopped onion</strong></li>
        <li>1/4 cup <strong>cilantro, chopped</strong></li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, cream, and lemon or lime juice</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, stir together the onions and cilantro. Set this garnish and the cream sauce aside for the moment.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in small pan and saute the tuna, stirring often, until the tuna is heated through and very slightly browned. Take the pan off the heat.</li>
        <li>If using soft tortillas, heat the griddle/pan over a high heat and place them on it. Heat the tortillas, turning once or twice in the process, until they are very hot. For hard tacos shells place them on a baking sheet and heat until crispy. </li>
        <li>Place 1/4 of the tuna mixture onto each tortilla, then top each with some of the onion-cilantro mix and drizzle of cream sauce</li>
        <li>Serve tacos immediately. Add bottled hot sauce or other condiments of choice if wanted. Enjoy!</li>
